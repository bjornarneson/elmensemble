On the third Sunday in Lent, we gather in a service of evening prayer to sing a timeless liturgy and hear a performance of Bach's Cantata 12, **Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen**.

Special guest musicians:
- [Paul Westermeyer](http://www.paulwestermeyer.com/), guest conductor
- [Clara Osowski](http://claraosowskimezzo.com/), alto
- [Roy Heilman](http://royheilman.com/), tenor
- [Aaron Larson](http://www.aaronjlarson.com/), bass

A freewill offering for our 2015 community parter, the [Lutheran Summer Music](http://www.lutheransummermusic.org) Scholarship Fund, will be received during the service. Founded in 1981, the Lutheran Summer Music Academy and Festival is a four-week residential training and performance program for gifted high school students. Each summer, LSM brings together over 150 band, orchestra, choir, and keyboard students from across the United States and abroad in a supportive, intentional community. Students in grades 8-12 live together on a college campus and focus on musical excellence, faith formation, and personla growth. Financing a young musician's journey to LSM is no small endeavor---tuition for LSM 2014 was $3,195. Last summer, LSM awarded more than $145,000 in need-based assistance and merit-based scholarships to more than 80% of its students.
